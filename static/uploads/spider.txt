Incy wincy spider
Climbed up the waterspout
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out
Out came the sunshine
And dried up all the rain
And incy wincy spider
Climbed up the spout again.
Incy wincy spider
Climbed up a tree
Down came the snow
And made poor incy freeze
Out came the sunshine
And melted all the snow
So incy wincy spider
Had another go.
